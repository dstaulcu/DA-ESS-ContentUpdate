action.escu.eli5 = Obtaining access to the Command-Line Interface (CLI) is typically a primary attacker goal. Once an attacker has obtained the ability to execute code on a target system, they will often further manipulate the system via commands passed to the CLI. It is also unusual for many applications to spawn a command shell during normal operation, while it is often observed if an application has been compromised in some way. As such, it is often beneficial to look for cmd.exe being executed by processes that are often targeted for exploitation, or that would not spawn cmd.exe in any other circumstances. A lookup file is provided to easily modify the processes that are being watched for execution of cmd.exe.
action.escu.how_to_implement = To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with both the process name and parent process from your endpoints.

action.escu.eli5 = This search may look complex, but it's a neat representation of how statistics can help you understand your dataset to bubble up events that are not normal compared to its behavior. The search consists of three parts. The first part of the SPL fetches the data you want to work on. In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.
action.escu.how_to_implement = This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.

Malicious PowerShell use almost always includes the parameter <code>-ExecutionPolicy bypass</code>. PowerShell is very liberal when it comes to interpreting command-line parameters passed to it. For example, the parameter we look for, <code>-ExecutionPolicy</code>, can be abbreviated to <code>-Execution</code>, <code>-Exec</code>, or even <code>-ex</code>. As such, we look for <code>* -ex*</code>, which should catch all variations of this parameter, followed by the keyword <code>bypass</code>.

For Windows endpoints, Microsoft typically releases patches on the second Tuesday of every month. These patches contain fixes for vulnerabilities in the system that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors. This search checks for messages regarding Windows updates in the 'Update' data model. If a message indicating a successful update has not been observed in 60 days, a notable event will be generated. These systems should be checked to determine why it has not been updated in that time frame.

This can be accomplished by ingesting Windows events or the Windows Update log via a universal forwarder on the Windows endpoints you wish to monitor.

The purpose of the hosts file is to provide a mapping between hostnames and IP addresses, the same way DNS is used to provide such a mapping. However, the information in the hosts file takes precedence over information received via DNS, and a DNS query will not be issued if the hostname of interest is found in the hosts file. As such, attackers have been observed adding entries to the host file to override any DNS resolution. For this reason, it is useful to monitor for changes to this file, which typically do not occur very often in legitimate cases.

After identifying these systems, you will need to add the "common_rdp_source" or "common_rdp_destination" category to that system depending on the usage, using the Enterprise Security Assets and Identities framework.  This can be done by adding an entry in the assets.csv file located in SA-IdentityManagement/lookups.

action.escu.eli5 = This search may look complex, but it's a neat representation of how statistics can help you understand your dataset to bubble up events that are not normal compared to its behavior. The search consists of three parts. The first part of the SPL fetches the data you want to work on. In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.
action.escu.how_to_implement = This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized as "email_server" for the search to work, as well. You may need to adjust the deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples values based on the network traffic in your environment. The "deviation_threshold" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The "minimum_data_samples" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.
